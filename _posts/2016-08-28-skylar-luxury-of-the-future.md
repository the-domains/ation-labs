## An amazing display of innovation.

The key to our desk experience is the display. It's how awesome you interact using our Multi-Touch, and how you view everything on the our unique large 32" display with incredible detail. That's why we integrated our most realistic Ultra display. The 32" has the highest resolution of any device of it's kind. With 100 finger touches simultaneously and 5ms of touch response makes it the fastest large format procap ever. The thick beautiful glass, is made out of our revolutionary reflective glass, which means the light won't affect your eyes and you will get perfect paper like view.

## Let's talk about future.

We are creating future not just in words but in facts. Our desk has all the connectivity you will ever need eliminating your old keyboard and traditional boring mouse, along with all the cables and graphic tablets and any sort of peripheral you used before. We come with our own designed software that integrates with all known softwares available from Mac OSX to Microsofts windows to even Chrome we have it all.

## Charging, we make it wireless.

We take out all the cables and make it wireless. Charging your phone has never been as easy as just putting on the desk. We make it so simple that it will just come natural.

## Where did I put that cable ?

We know the struggle of finding that HDMI or usb cable or whatever other adapter you may need. With our desk that is a thing of the past. With HDMI, usb 3.0, thunderbolt, mini HDMI, card reader and mini USB connection cables are in the past. So whenever you need to connect you just do it, without the hassle of having boxes full of unnecessary cables.

## We all want POWER and privacy.

We have our amazing CPU powered by Intel at 2.3GHz, with 8 gb of RAM and powerful integrated video camera powered by nVidia. All of which are fully upgradable in the future. We know documents are a thing of the past, that's why you have our unique encrypted 256 SSD storage that is also cloud base, so only you have access to all your private documents no matter where you may be.

## Last but not least, the beauty of each detail.

We have been obsessed with details, thats why every line, every corner it's been meticulously designed and crafted to perfection. We value technology but value as much the beauty of design.
